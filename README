# rescribe.xyz/preproc package

This package contains various image processing methods which are
useful for preprocessing page images for OCR. It also contains
several commands in the cmd/ directory which can be used to
preprocess images directly.

# Commands

There are several commands in the cmd/ directory which are useful
in their own right as well as serving as examples of using the
package.

  - binarize     : binarises an image using the sauvola algorithm
  - preproc      : binarises and wipes an image
  - preprocmulti : binarises and wipes an image with multiple
                   binarisation ksize values
  - wipe         : wipes sections of an image that are outside an
                   area detected as content

# Bugs

The integral image operations don't produce exactly the same result
as their non-integral image counterparts. The difference is small
enough that it has little effect on the output images, but it ought
to be identical.
